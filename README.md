# ai-friend
The repository contains a friendly empathetic chat-bot


# Model

**LLaMa2-7B-Chat** model is used in this chat-bot since its completely open for commercial usage and provides a great balance between the quality and model size

# Prerequisites



# Further improvements

* Taking summary of chat history instead of the whole history to make the model input lighweight and enable longer conversations
* More experiments with proper prompt engineering to regulate model behaviour
* Longer fine tuning with diverse system prompts to make model forget about some of its limitations and open up to the user
* Efficient scalable inference using vLLM or TGI
